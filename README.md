# üìñ diAry ‚Äî Digital Arianna

_Let‚Äôs stop COVID-19 together._  
A project developed by the [University of Urbino](https://www.uniurb.it) and [DIGIT srl](http://digit.srl).

## The project

[Digital Arianna‚Äù, **diAry**](https://covid19app.uniurb.it/en/diary-lets-stop-covid-19-together/), is a mobile application that allows to **keep trace**, on your own device and in any circumstance, of movements that are relevant to the containment of the diffusion of COVID-19. To face the diffusion of the virus, it is essential to be able to trace back to all the locations and people that have been met during the incubation period.
All data is exclusively **stored on the personal device of the user**, who can freely decide to examine, export, and eventually intersect them with information of public utility.

Adopting **responsible behaviors and keeping track of them** is the most effective way that each individual can contribute to public health. The contribution is recognized and quantified in terms of [WOM vouchers](https://wom.social), special certificates that recognize the social value of individual actions.

## Roadmap

* **By 10th April**: publication on Google Play store.
* **Within April**: definition of the open data specification, the data upload API and other data formats.
* To be updated.

_Coming to Google Play very soon‚Ä¶_
